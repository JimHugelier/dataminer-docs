# DataMiner Cloud Platform

The DataMiner Cloud Platform provides a host of additional services augmenting your DataMiner System.

The home page of the platform is available via <https://dataminer.services>. For more information on how to log on, see [Logging on to the DataMiner Cloud Platform](xref:Logging_on_to_the_DataMiner_Cloud_Platform).

On this home page, you will find links to the different available DCP apps:

- [Project Collaboration](xref:Collaboration)

- [DataMiner Catalog](xref:Catalog)

- [DataMiner Sharing](xref:Sharing)

- [DataMiner Community](xref:Community)

- [DCP Admin](xref:CloudAdminApp)

  > [!NOTE]
  > The DCP Admin app is only displayed on the home page for the owner/administrator of the organization and/or DataMiner System.

The home page also lists the DataMiner Systems that have been [connected to the cloud](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud), provides links to different URLs for remote access, and allows you to [link your DCP and DataMiner account](xref:Linking_your_DataMiner_and_DCP_account).

When your DMS has been connected to the cloud, you can also make use of the [DataMiner Teams bot](xref:DataMiner_Teams_bot).
