# Secure Shell

## About SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network.

It replaces older protocols like Telnet or rlogin.

The specification of the SSH protocol (version 2) can be found in the following RFCs:

- RFC 4251: The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture
- RFC 4252: The Secure Shell (SSH) Authentication Protocol
- RFC 4253: The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol
- RFC 4254: The Secure Shell (SSH) Connection Protocol

> [!NOTE]
> This list is not exhaustive.

## Defining an SSH connection in a protocol

There are two ways to establish an SSH connection in a protocol.

1. Using password authentication.
1. Using public key authentication (identity file).

Apart from the specification of the connection credentials, the protocol is the same as any other serial driver
that does not use SSH (e.g. the use of headers, trailers and timeout time for responses are supported).

> [!NOTE]
> Typically, both approaches are implemented in a protocol to give the user the choice how to connect. When both settings are configured, the identify file approach has precedence over password authentication, as this is considered more secure.

### Password

The credentials (username and password) method requires two parameters to be created, one with option "ssh username" and the other with option "ssh pwd".

The connection is then established by DataMiner, provided the correct username and password are filled in.

```xml
<Param id="1100" trending="false" save="true">
    <Name>User Name</Name>
    <Description>User Name</Description>
    <Type options="SSH Username">read</Type>
    <Interprete>
        <RawType>other</RawType>
        <LengthType>next param</LengthType>
        <Type>string</Type>
    </Interprete>

                <Row>0</Row>
                <Column>0</Column>
            </Position>
        </Positions>
    </Display>
    <Measurement>
        <Type>string</Type>

</Param>
<Param id="1102" trending="false" save="true">
    <Name>Password</Name>
    <Description>Password</Description>
    <Type options="SSH PWD">read</Type>
    <Interprete>
        <RawType>other</RawType>
        <LengthType>next param</LengthType>
        <Type>string</Type>
    </Interprete>
    <Display>
        <RTDisplay>true</RTDisplay>
        <Positions>
            <Position>
                <Page>Security Settings</Page>
                <Row>1</Row>
                <Column>0</Column>
            </Position>
        </Positions>
    </Display>
    <Measurement>
    <Type>string</Type>
    </Measurement>
</Param>
```

### Public key authentication

When you use the identity file method, a parameter using the option "ssh options" needs to be defined.

The content of the “ssh options” parameter is:

```
Key=path to the identity file;pass=passphrase
```

```xml
<Param id="1200" trending="false" save="true">
    <Name>SSH Options</Name>
    <Description>SSH Options</Description>
    <Type options="SSH Options">read</Type>
    <Interprete>
        <RawType>other</RawType>
        <LengthType>next param</LengthType>
        <Type>string</Type>
    </Interprete>
    <Display>
        <RTDisplay>true</RTDisplay>
        <Positions>
            <Position>
                <Page>Security Settings</Page>
                <Row>2</Row>
                <Column>0</Column>
                </Position>
        </Positions>
    </Display>
    <Measurement>
    <Type>string</Type>
    </Measurement>
</Param>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Once authentication is successful, the socket timeout is set to 0 (no timeout) to prevent the connection being closed when no activity occurred on the SSH connection for "timeoutTime" ms (RN 3303).

## Differences with serial communication

There are a number of differences between implementing serial communication and implementing serial communication using an SSH connection.

- Headers are not supported for SSH. Only trailers.
- For commands sent via SSH, you do not need to send the Carriage Return (0x0D) and New Line (0x0A) characters to indicate the end of the command. This is done automatically.
- Separating multiple SSH commands using ';' or 'enters' inside one DataMiner command is not supported.
- The first part of a response is the corresponding command that has been sent.

## Selecting a local port

Up to DataMiner 7.0.3, DataMiner uses the same SSH connection if the polling IP is the same (RN 3859), which can cause problems. A workaround is to specify a different local IP port in the element wizard.

By default, it is not possible to change the local IP port in the element wizard. Therefore you need to define the following in the protocol:

```xml
<PortSettings>
    <LocalIPport>
        <DefaultValue>200</DefaultValue>
        <Disabled>false</Disabled>
    </LocalIPport>
</PortSettings>
```

## SSH logging

A dedicated log file is used for the SSH connections: "SLSSH.txt". Standard logging provides information about the following:

- Create Object
- Open 1.2.3.4
- Open Exception
- Open Completed
- Connect 1.2.3.4
- Connect Exception
- Connect Complete
- Close
- Close Exception
- Close Complete
- Set Timeout
- Set Timeout Exception
- Set RetryTime
- Trailer=\<none>
- Trailer=\<xxx> (x times)
- Read Exception
- Write Exception
- WriteLine Exception

More logging can be obtained by creating a file with the name "SLSSHExt.txt". This will activate extended logging and DataMiner will then write additional information regarding the beginning and end of reads/writes and what data is written/read to this log file.

> [!NOTE]
> Extended logging uses a lot of memory, so do not keep this running if it is not needed.

## Selecting the key exchange algorithm

From DataMiner 9.5.1 (RN 13897) onwards, it is possible to specify the key exchange algorithm to be used when connecting to an SSH server.

You can do so by defining a serial connection that specifies the key exchange algorithm in the KexAlgorithms tag.

```xml
<Connection id="1" name="SSH Connection">
    <Type>serial</Type>
    <CommunicationOptions>
        <KexAlgorithms>
        <KexAlgorithm>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</KexAlgorithm>
        <KexAlgorithm>diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1</KexAlgorithm>
        </KexAlgorithms>
    </CommunicationOptions>
</Connection>
```

## SCP/SFTP

When SCP or SFTP needs to be implemented in a protocol, it is advisable to reference the SSH.NET library in a QAction. See https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET.
